# Consultancy

The core consultancy offering covers the day to day operation of a software engineering function within your business. 

- Expert advice to non-IT executives, helping to remove jargon and deeper understanding of how to work with your engineering team.
- Advice around delivery methodologies and how they fit into your organisation.
- Assist IT teams on how to approach audits and deal with governance.
- Project delivery and management.

I’m not your average consultant, I won’t be coming in and asking people to place sticky notes on the wall and coming up with a two year plan that will be forgotten within a week. For me it’s all about having direct conversations and giving the best advice I can to those people who need it the most. From my experience the majority of businesses fall into the same traps when it comes to IT and software delivery. There are no easy fixes and it’s all about commitment from non-IT areas to better understand IT and in turn improve the processes and ultimately the delivery of those key IT deliverables.
